# INF 528 Final Assignment Repository

This repository contains the final assignment of the INF 528 Advanced Topics in Computer Engineering lecture.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build upon the foundation provided by the [Knowledge-Graph-based-QnA](https://github.com/vibhavnirmal/Knowledge-Graph-based-QnA) repository. Our main objectives for this assignment are:

1. **QA System for Computer Engineering Students**: Our primary goal is to create a Question-Answering (QA) System tailored for Computer Engineering students at GSU (Galatasaray University). 

2. **Data Preparation for Computer Engineering Courses**: We will curate and prepare data specific to Computer Engineering courses to enhance the functionality of the QA System. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

3. **New Question Types**: Introduce additional question types, such as "HOW," to broaden the range of queries supported by the system. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

4. **Improvements to Plot Graph and Entity Options**: Enhance the visualization of plot graphs and refine entity options to make them more user-friendly and accessible. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

5. **Accuracy for Complex Structured Sentences**: Work towards improving the accuracy of the QA System, especially when dealing with complex structured sentences. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
